# ðŸŽ­ Text Emotion Detection App

This is a simple AI-powered web app that detects emotions from user-input text. It was built as a **beginner project** to learn the basics of **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Streamlit**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

I created this project as part of my learning journey in **Artificial Intelligence**. The goal was to understand how text data can be processed and classified into different emotions using machine learning models.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Text Input**: Users enter any text.
2. **Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned (user handles removed, stopwords filtered).
3. **Prediction**: A trained machine learning model (Logistic Regression) predicts the emotion.
4. **Results**:
   - The predicted emotion with an emoji and confidence score
   - A bar chart showing the probability distribution across all emotions
   - An insight message describing the detected emotion
